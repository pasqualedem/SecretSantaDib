OFFICIAL RULES:
- The budget of the gift is around 10 to 15 euros
- DON'T TELL ANYONE WHO IS YOUR CHILD with an exception
- Each Santa will choose ONE person, let's call it, the Santa Helper. The Santa can reveal the identity of his child to this person. His job is to give advices and to investigate for the gift of the person who claimed its help. The helper can even directly ask to child, obviously without revealing the identity of the Santa
- You can choose any participant as Santa Helper.
- As a consequence, each participant can be a Santa Helper for more participants
- THE SANTA HELPER MUST NOT REVEAL ANYONE THE IDENTITY OF THE SANTA AND THE CHILD.
- You can deposit your gift the exchange day or some days before.
- When you arrive with your present, please use a bag to hide it, then remove it from your bag when you deposit. In this way the other people will not see your present when you are arriving.
- You have to manually wrap your present with the gift wrapping (just the amazon box is not allowed)
- Couples will be not extracted as each other Santa/Child, to make the game not trivial.

Any violation of the rules will result on imprisonment at floor -2.
